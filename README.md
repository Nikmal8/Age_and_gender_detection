## Introduction
The age and gender detection project focuses on analyzing facial features and predicting the age group and gender of a person. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy.

## Features
- Real-time age and gender prediction from images or video streams
- Robust model performance across diverse demographics
- Easy integration with existing applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- Pre-trained CNN models (e.g., ageNEt, genderNet)
